Change the slides on intermittant upwelling.

Point out that upwelling is a bottom up process that supplies nutrients.

But, the nutrients are wasted because larval recruitment is lowered because larvae lost to sea (upwelling) or carried down deep (downwelling). 

Intermittant upwelling allows larval recruitment so prey species abundance greatly increases. This allows top-down predation pressure to then regulate prey abundance.

IF upwelling/downwelling constant, then prey population never gets very large so upper trophic levels also limited. (bottom up)
