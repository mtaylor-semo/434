 FOR CRITICAL ANALYSES
 
 Have them identify and compare the specific hypotheses and predictions of each paper.
 
 Have them write what they think is the 1-2 key points of each paper.
 
 Have them write 1-2 questions about each paper that they don't understand. Do not ask why the did a particular method, and do not tell me that you did not understand the statistics. The question should be about the main point of the paper, the conclusions, etc.
 
 Don't worry about methods or perceived flaws. We're interested in the big picture.
