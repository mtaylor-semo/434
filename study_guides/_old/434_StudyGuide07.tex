\section{Concepts}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  What happens to the nutritional quality of marine snow as it descends
  from the epipelagic to the abyssal plain. Why?
\item
  What are the primary differences between hydrothermal vents and cold
  seeps. Consider energy sources, temperature, diversity, and endemism.
\item
  I argued that nutrient limitation drives most of the community
  interactions in the deep-sea. What is the basis of my argument? How do
  space and light fit into this argument?
\item
  What are the stages of succession that have been described for whale
  fall communities? Name and describe each stage, in the order of
  occurrence from first to last. Include approximately the length (time) of each stage.
\item
  About how much NPP is exported from hydrothermal vents and cold seeps?
  What are other sources of NPP to the deep-sea communities?
\item
  Although the amount of NPP leaving hydrothermal vent communities is
  minimal, some is exported to the larger deep sea habitat. Briefly
  describe the ways in which NPP can leave the vent communities.
\item
  Most chemosynthetic bacteria live in a fairly narrow area around the
  hydrothermal vents. Why is this area restricted in size?
\item
  Chemosynthetic bacteria can actually be found well away from the
  actual hot vents. Where would you find these bacteria? (I don't know
  if this answer is blindingly obvious or not.)
\item
  Briefly explain how plate tectonics relates to the formation of
  hydrothermal vent communities. How does plate tectonics explain why
  hydrothermal vent communities are temporary?
\item
  Study deep-water coral mounds on your own.
 \end{enumerate}
